Here are the time break downs I spent on this project:

2 Hours - Setting up Symfony 5 and get my hands on Symfony framework
1 Hour - Adding required composer and node packages (Bootstrap, Fontawesome etc) to prettify the design
10 mins - Coding each Checker function
5 mins - Coding each checker Unit Test

Overall - 3 hours and 45 mins
